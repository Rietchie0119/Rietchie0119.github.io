## Project Description
This project aims to develop a novel foot-based controller for virtual reality (VR) systems. We believe a foot-based system is well-suited for VR because utilizing one's feet provides a more intuitive and natural match for VR locomotion compared to handheld controllers, which also lacks portability. To validate this approach, I conducted data gathering and preprocessing for a comprehensive user study focusing on the implementation of a foot control model within a virtual reality setting (submitted to CHI 2024).
