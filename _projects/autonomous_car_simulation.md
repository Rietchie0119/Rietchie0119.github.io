## Project Description
This work is a Self-driving Car program based on the open-source self-driving car simulator offered by Udacity. This is achieved through the "Behavioral Cloning" technique, where the model learns to mimic a human driver's steering behavior.The model was trained using data collected by driving the car three laps in the simulator, recording images and the corresponding steering angle. The project utilizes the NVIDIA model architecture for training.
