## Project Description
This is a research work that enhaces SuGaR (Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting) framework for reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data. It improves the original SuGaR model by introducing two new, synergistic regularization strategies during the coarse optimization phase: Effective Rank Regularization (Local Fidelity) and Implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) Constraint (Global Coherence). The extracted meshes from ARGS show better coverage (fewer white areas), better rendering of fine details (like an electric wire), and fewer artifacts compared to the original SuGaR model.
