## Project Description
This work explores image classification using different machine learning techniques: K-means Codebook (Bag-of-Words), Random Forest (RF) Codebook, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The images were sourced from the Caltech101 dataset , resized, and split into training and testing data, mostly with an 8:2 ratio for the Bag-of-Words/RF-Classifier sections.
