## Project Description
This work implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify road signs. It classify road signs, tackling the challenge of a non-uniformly distributed dataset with 42 different classes. It employs various image processing techniques, including Grayscale conversion, Histogram equalization, Data augmentation to facilitate classification.
