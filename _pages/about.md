Accomplished Computer Science and Applied Mathematics graduate (BS & MS) with a strong foundation in interdisciplinary problem-solving. My Master's research specialized in Computer Vision and Graphics with AI, specifically bridging the gap between 3DGS and mesh data. I also have experience in areas like image processing, 3D reconstruction, and generative models. My current interests lie in AI assisted 2D image to 3D model conversion, video to 4D conversion, 3D mesh upscaling, and interactive AI world models.
